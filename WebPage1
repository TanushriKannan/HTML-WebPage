        <p style="font-size: 17px">Our Online Full Stack Development Course, starting on July 1st, covers everything needed to become a proficient full stack developer. It begins with front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and progresses to back-end (Node.js, Express.js), including database management (SQL, NoSQL). The course emphasizes practical skills through hands-on projects, covering RESTful API design, authentication, security, version control (Git, GitHub), and deployment (AWS, Heroku). Participants benefit from mentorship, community support, and regular assessments. By the end, learners will have a comprehensive skill set and portfolio, ready for a full stack development career.
